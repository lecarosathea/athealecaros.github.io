    <h3>SELF INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Athea S. Lecaros. I am 19 years old and currently reside in Bahi, Gasan, and Marinduque. I am currently a college student at Marinduque State College, pursuing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. When I have free time, I enjoy spending it on my favorite activities. Dancing is one of my favorite hobbies, allowing me to reduce stress and stay active. I also enjoy reading fictional stories because they offer me an escape from reality. Lastly, my love for movies and series. They are my go-to when I need to unwind and immerse myself in fascinating narratives.  </p>
